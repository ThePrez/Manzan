Manzan consists of the following components:
- **Adapter**: Receives callback from system facilities and parses the individual data points out of the structures passed from the system
- **Router**: Directs the mssage to the proper publisher based on configuration settings
- **Publishers**: Transforms the message data into an appropriate format and places it in an appropriate location

There are three publishers:
- **JSON publisher**: Publishes the data in JSON format to a Manzan-provided data queue (in the Manzan installation library)
- **Db2 Table Publisher**: Publishes the data into a set of Manzan-provided tables (one table for each event type). The table has autogenerated autoincrement and timestamp fields
- **MSGQ publisher**: Publishes a small description of the event to a Manzan-provided data queue or a user-configured queue.

Manzan also includes these components not included in the above graphic:
- **Apache Camel**: An Apache Camel route to publish JSON data to some new medium, for instance Kafka, ELK, SMS, or AI
- **Base Template classes**: A set of pre-made configurations that perform common system monitoring tasks
- **Configuration manager**: Handles user configuration for all of the above.
